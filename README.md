# Basic-AI-algorithms-in-C-sharp
Implementation of a Genetic Algorithm Project, a Neural Network Project and Fuzzy Logic Project in C#. No use of existing libraries.

In this repository are 3 projects.

Project 1 - Genetic Algorithm for Cards

There are N cards and we need to separate them in M piles based on some conditions eg: 

pile 1 has sum 45
pile 2 has sum 21
pile 3 has prod 106
etc

Project 2 - Neural Network for the 6-bit parity problem

The 6 bit parity problem. Input 6 bits , produce the parity bit.

The parity bit is 0 if the number of 1s is even and the parity bit is 1 if the number of 1s is odd.

The 6 bit parity problem was the goal. The code implements the 3 bit parity problem , but it is easily expandable in N bits.

Project 3 - Fuzzy Logic for an Emergency Break

The Emergency Break must be activated at 30 km/h AND distance 10m.

In the code there are various rules to show how to create rules in C#.
